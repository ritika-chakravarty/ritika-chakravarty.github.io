  about: `I am a data-driven professional with a strong foundation in analytics and business strategy. At Schneider Electric, I have worked with cross-functional teams to develop dashboards, automate reporting, and standardize data processes, enabling more informed decision-making.

With a Master's in Business Analytics and hands-on experience in Power BI, Tableau, Python, and SQL, I excel at translating complex data into actionable insights. My growing focus is on understanding business needs, optimizing processes, and driving efficiency beyond reporting.

I am now looking to transition into a Business Analyst role where I can bridge data analytics with strategic problem-solving to support business growth.`,
